== Getting Started with Che IDE

In this lab you will get familiar with the using Eclipse Che for developing using Quarkus.

For completing the following labs, you can either use your own workstation or as an
alternative, Eclipse Che web IDE. The advantage of your own workstation is that you use the
environment that you are familiar with while the advantage of Eclipse Che is that all
tools needed (Maven, Git, OpenShift CLI, etc ) are pre-installed in it (not on your workstation!) and all interactions
takes place within the browser which removes possible internet speed issues and version incompatibilities
on your workstation.

The choice is yours but whatever you pick, like most things in life, stick with it for all the labs. We
ourselves are in love with Eclipse Che and highly recommend it.

== Setup Your Workspace on Eclipse Che

Follow these instructions to setup the development environment on Eclipse Che.

You might be familiar with the Eclipse IDE which is one of the most popular IDEs for Java and other
programming languages. https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che] is the next-generation Eclipse IDE which is web-based
and gives you a full-featured IDE running in the cloud. You have an Eclipse Che instance deployed on your OpenShift cluster
which you will use during these labs.

Go to the link:{{ ECLIPSE_CHE_URL }}[Eclipse Che url] in order to configure your development workspace: {{ ECLIPSE_CHE_URL }}

First, you need to login user the Id that you have been assigned which we will refer to as X for the rest of the workshop

* Username: `userX`
* Password: `{{ECLIPSE_CHE_PASSWORD}}`

Log into Eclipse Che with your user. You can now create your workspace based on a stack. A
stack is a template of workspace configuration. For example, it includes the programming language and tools needed
in your workspace. Stacks make it possible to recreate identical workspaces with all the tools and needed configuration
on-demand.

For this lab, click on the *Quarkus Development* stack and then on the *Create* button.

It takes a little while for the workspace to be ready. When it's ready, you will see a fully functional
Eclipse Che IDE running in your browser.
